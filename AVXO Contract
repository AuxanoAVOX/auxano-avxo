# CONTRACT

This document describes what the **Auxano (AVXO)** smart contract **does** and, more importantly, **what it cannot do**.

It is written for non-developers.

---

## Overview

Auxano (AVXO) is a fixed-supply digital artifact implemented as a Soroban (SEP-41) token contract on the Stellar mainnet.

The contract was designed with **minimal capability** and **no ongoing authority**.

Once initialized, the contract cannot be altered.

---

## Supply

- Total supply is **fixed at 77,000,000,000 AVXO**
- Supply is minted **once**, during contract initialization
- No function exists to mint additional tokens
- No function exists to change the supply

**Inflation is impossible.**

---

## Ownership & Control

The contract has **no admin role**.

There is:
- No owner
- No controller
- No privileged wallet
- No emergency authority

After initialization, **no address has special power**.

---

## Transfers

- Tokens may be transferred freely by their holder
- Transfers require cryptographic authorization by the sending address
- Standard SEP-41 allowance and `transfer_from` mechanics are supported

The contract does **not** restrict:
- Who may hold AVXO
- How long AVXO may be held
- Where AVXO may be sent

---

## Burning

- The contract **does not permit burning**
- No address can destroy tokens
- No address can destroy tokens on behalf of others

Tokens may only be removed from circulation through:
- Loss of private keys
- Voluntary abandonment

This mirrors the behavior of physical objects.

---

## Freezing, Pausing, or Seizing

The contract does **not** support:

- Freezing balances
- Pausing transfers
- Blacklisting addresses
- Seizing tokens
- Reclaiming tokens
- Forcing transfers

All balances are sovereign to their holder.

---

## Upgrades

- The contract contains **no upgrade hooks**
- The code cannot be replaced
- The logic cannot be modified
- The behavior cannot be extended

What exists now is final.

---

## External Control

The contract:
- Makes no external calls
- Depends on no off-chain services
- Has no oracles
- Has no governance modules

It operates entirely within its own logic.

---

## Summary of Guarantees

The Auxano contract guarantees:

- Fixed supply
- No inflation
- No admin powers
- No seizure
- No burning
- No freezing
- No upgrades

---

## Final Statement

This contract does not manage behavior.

It records state.

AVXO is not governed — it is **encountered**.
