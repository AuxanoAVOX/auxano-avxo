# Security Policy

This document outlines the security posture of the **Auxano (AVXO)** smart contract and how the community may engage with it.

---

## Contract Status

- The Auxano (AVXO) contract is **immutable**
- The contract has **no admin privileges**
- The contract has **no upgrade mechanism**
- The contract has **no minting capability beyond initialization**

As a result, no changes can be made to the contract after deployment.

---

## Scope

This repository contains:

- The complete Soroban smart contract source code
- Supporting configuration files
- Documentation describing the contract’s behavior

No off-chain services, APIs, or external dependencies are used.

---

## Vulnerability Reporting

Because the contract is immutable, **no patches can be applied**.

If a vulnerability is discovered:

- It should be reported publicly
- Findings should reference specific source lines or behaviors
- Independent verification is encouraged

There is no private disclosure channel.

---

## Responsible Review

Community review is welcomed.

Reviewers are encouraged to focus on:

- Unauthorized minting vectors
- Unauthorized transfer or seizure paths
- Privilege escalation
- Supply manipulation
- Reentrancy or logic errors
- State corruption

---

## Wallet Security

Security of private keys is the responsibility of token holders.

The contract does not provide:
- Key recovery
- Account guardianship
- Transfer reversal

Loss of keys results in permanent loss of access.

---

## Third-Party Tools

Interactions with the contract may occur through:
- Wallet software
- Explorers
- Custom clients

The security of these tools is **outside the scope** of this repository.

---

## Final Note

This project favors simplicity over complexity.

Security is achieved through:
- Minimal logic
- Fixed behavior
- Absence of authority

Trust arises from transparency.
