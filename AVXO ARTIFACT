# ARTIFACT

**Auxano (AVXO)** is a completed work.

It is not a platform, a roadmap, or a promise.  
It does not ask for participation, governance, or belief.

It exists.

---

## Statement of Form

AVXO was brought into existence with fixed boundaries:

- A finite quantity
- A defined precision
- A single moment of creation
- No capacity for alteration thereafter

The contract does not evolve.  
The supply does not grow.  
Authority does not persist.

The work is whole.

---

## On Scarcity

Scarcity here is not enforced through control, but through absence.

No function exists to reclaim, seize, or alter what has been issued.  
Loss is possible only through misplacement, forgetfulness, or time.

This mirrors physical reality rather than engineered economics.

What is gone is gone.

---

## On Meaning

AVXO does not encode meaning.

Meaning is assigned by:
- Time
- Context
- Observation
- Use
- Neglect

As with all artifacts, its value is not intrinsic to its material, but to the relationships formed around it.

---

## Authorship

AVXO was released by **Black Doorway Incorporated** as a creative commodity.

Authorship ends at release.

No claim is made over interpretation, outcome, or trajectory.

---

## Completion

There are no future code changes.  
There are no upgrades.  
There are no corrections.

This artifact does not seek optimization.

It is finished.
