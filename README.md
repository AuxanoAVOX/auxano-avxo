# Auxano (AVXO)

**Auxano (AVXO)** is a fixed-supply creative commodity issued on the Stellar network using Soroban smart contracts.

AVXO is not positioned as a utility token, governance token, or financial instrument.  
It is presented as a **creative artifact** — a digitally native work whose form, scarcity, and behavior are fully defined at inception and remain immutable thereafter.

## Creative Framing

AVXO is framed as a **creative commodity** — analogous to a finished artwork rather than an evolving protocol.

Its properties are intentional:
- Finite supply
- No inflation
- No administrative access to user balances
- No governance hooks
- No upgrade paths

Once deployed and initialized, the contract’s behavior is fully determined.

Ownership of AVXO represents possession of a scarce digital object whose meaning and value arise organically through time, context, and collective interpretation.

## Philosophy of Scarcity

The absence of burn functions, mint functions, or administrative overrides is a deliberate design choice.

Loss of tokens can occur only through:
- Voluntary transfer
- Loss of private keys

This mirrors physical scarcity rather than engineered scarcity.

---

## Provenance

- **Smart Contract Language:** Rust (Soroban SDK)
- **Deployment Environment:** Stellar Mainnet
- **Deployment Method:** Soroban smart contract
- **Source Code:** Public and auditable

The contract source code is provided openly to allow independent verification that no hidden issuance, backdoors, or privileged controls exist.

---

## Attribution

AVXO is a creative commodity built by **Black Doorway Incorporated**.

The issuer does not claim ongoing authority over the asset after deployment.  
The work exists independently once released.

---

## Disclaimer

AVXO is not presented as:
- An investment product
- A security
- A promise of future utility
- A governance instrument

It is a creative digital artifact released into an open network.

## Closing Note

AVXO is complete.
